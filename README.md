# Markdown Previewer with React and Redux

This Markdown Previewer is a web application built with React and Redux that allows you to create, edit, and preview Markdown documents. It includes the following features:

- **Toggle Windows**: Maximize and minimize the Editor and Previewer independently.

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Organized into reusable components, including Toolbar, Editor, and Previewer.
